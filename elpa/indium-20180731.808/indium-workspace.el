;;; Commentary:

;; Indium workspace management.
;;
;; When connecting to a backend, Indium will lookup and read a project
;; configuration file `.indium.json' in the project root directory.

;;; .indium.json configuration file example:
;;
;; {
;;   "configurations": [
;; 	{
;; 	  "name": "Chrome",
;; 	  "type": "chrome",
;; 	  "url": "http://localhost:3333/"
;; 	},
;; 	{
;; 	  "name": "Node server",
;; 	  "type": "node",
;; 	  "command": "node ./src/server.js",
;; 	  "inspect-brk": false
;; 	}
;; 	{
;; 	  "name": "Gulp",
;; 	  "type": "node",
;; 	  "command": "node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js default",
;; 	  "inspect-brk": true
;; 	}
;;   ]
;; }

;;; Available settings:
;;
;; "type": Type of runtime (currently "node" or "chrome" are supported).
;;
;; "root": Relative path to the root directory from where files are served.
;;         Alias: "webRoot".
;;
;; "sourceMapPathOverrides": Custom sourcemap mappings.  Maps source paths to
;;         locations on disk.
;;
;;         Default value:
;;
;;         {
;;           "webpack:///./~/": "${root}/node_modules/",
;;           "webpack:///./":   "${root}/",
;;           "webpack:///":     "/",
;;           "webpack:///src/": "${root}/"
;;         }
;;
;; Chrome-specific settings:
;;
;; "host": Host on which Chrome is running (defaults to "localhost").
;;
;; "port": Port on which Chrome is running (defaults to 9222).
;;
;; "url": Url to open when running `indium-launch-chrome'.
;;
;; Nodejs-specific settings:
;;
;; "command": Nodejs command to start a new process.  The `--inspect' flag will
;;            be added automatically.
;;
;; "inspect-brk": Whether Indium should break at the first statement (true by
;;            default).
;;
;; "host":    Host on which the Node inspector is listening (defaults to "localhost").
;;
;; "port": Port on which the Node inspector is listening (defaults to 9229).
